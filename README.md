# Activist Toolkit (GWC SIP)

### 👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
This is my Activist Toolkit for the 2023 Girls Who Code Virtual Summer Self-Paced Program. I worked on this project for a little less than a week  and used what I learned about `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` from the online videos to create thsi website. My activist's projects purpose is to inform students, parents, and the public about the lack in public school funding and the problems that this is causing for students.
