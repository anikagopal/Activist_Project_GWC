          Public school student's education should not be impaired due to lack of funding by the government's failed system.

        What are the problems caused by lack of funding for public schools? 
      </h1>

      <p>
       Due to large gaps between high and low-income families, the school funding system in economically deprived areas is not as proficient because it heavily relies on property taxes, resulting in wide disparities in funding. Additionally, many public schools do not have the resources to give students access to modern digital infrastructure, which denies students the chance to reach their academic goals. Studies have discovered a connection between government funding and student accomplishments as student education improves when schools are well-funded.iii Better materials, stable learning environments, and access to qualified teachers are all made possible by increased financing.   <br><br>
        The recent pandemic has profoundly affected student attendance, a vital component that influences the state funding school districts receive.If a student misses a day of school in Texas, the average attendance lowers which causes the school funding to drop. Another reason why student attendance has dropped is that some low-income families struggle to provide the basic needs for their children to attend school. In 2020, Congress passed the first stimulus bill which allocated 19 billion dollars into school funding, but officials used the 1.3 billion dollar education share to balance the state budget, leaving public schools’ pennies to pay for the damage of the pandemic. Education is the future of our country, and poor learning contributes to economic inequalities, thus, investing in public schools should be a top priority.

        What Texas Bill should be re introduced to help amend this consistent issue? 
      </h2>

      <p>
       Due to this persistent issue, a few solutions have been presented such as the TX H.B. 100. The House’s authorized version of this legislation contained investing 4.5 billion dollars in school financing to increase teacher salaries, and balance the budget as inflation reduced the value of money schools receive. After the proposal was sent to the state Senate, they edited the bill by incorporating other provisions that failed to become law, such as an education savings account, which is a program similar to student vouchers. The voucher program would enable parents who choose to homeschool their children to receive up to 8,000 dollars each year. This money would cover the cost of a children’s education and other educational costs like textbooks or external resources.
        <br><br> 
      Furthermore, since Senate made changes to the original legislation, the two versions of the bill needed to be consolidated, but neither the House nor Senate could come to a compromise. As a result, the bill died on May 26, 2023, because legislators were unable to come to an agreement before the crucial deadline. In order to improve the quality of student education, it is imperative that Congress reinstate this bill for discussion, and that both chambers come to an agreement on the terms of the legislation.

      <h3>
        What can we do to solve this problem? 
      </h3>

      <p>
        Even with external funds dedicated to public schools, this national problem will continue to arise as the funds will eventually run out again, creating an endless cycle. In order to solve this problem, I propose the idea of an annual fundraiser for schools in America. This fundraiser can be a fair, marathon, 5k run, or any other community activity that would be able to help the public support student education. <br><br>
        Schools in the same district could come together to hold this fundraiser during the summer, and with the help of students, faculty, or PTA members, this event could allot a reasonable sum of money for schools. Flyers, newsletters, or emails to students’ families are great ways to spread information to gain the public’s interest in this problem. This utopia won’t serve as a permanent solution, but it allows schools to recover after the hardships of the pandemic.
